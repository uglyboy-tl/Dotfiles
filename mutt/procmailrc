# ARTFUL PROCMAIL ALERT!
# Here are two rules that will automagically filter *most* list emails based on
# sane matches, such as list id. Very funky, and you almost never have to deal
# with folder-making for lists again.

# MOST LISTS - Automagically handle lists
:0
* ^((List-Id|X-(Mailing-)?List):(.*[<]\/[^>]*))
{
  LISTID=$MATCH

  :0:
  * LISTID ?? ^\/[^@\.]*
  In.list.$MATCH
}

# MAJORDOMO - Automagically handle Majordomo lists
:0
* ^Sender: owner-[^@]+@[^@\+]+
* ^Sender: owner-\/[^@\+]+
{
  :0:
  In.list.$MATCH
}

# little niave at the moment but I'll work with them for now and see how they
